# System-Design-and-Scalability

## Handling the Questions

* Communicate
* Go broad first 
* Use the whiteboard
* Acknowledge the concerns
* Be careful about assumptions
* State the assumptions explicitly
* Estimate when necessary
* Drive

## Design: Step-By-Step

* Step 1: Scope the Problem
* Step 2: Make Reasonable Assumptions
* Step 3: Draw the Major Components
* Step 4: Identify the Key Issues
* Step 5: Redesign for the Key Issues

## Algorithms that Scale: Step-By-Step

* Step 1: Ask Questions
* Step 2: Make Believe
* Step 3: Get Real
* Step 4: Solve Problems

## Key Concepts

* Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling
* Load Balancer
* Database Denormalization and NoSQL
* Database Partitioning (Sharding)
  - Vertical Partitioning
  - Key-Based (or Hash-Based) Partitioning
  - Directory-Based Partitioning
* Caching
* Asynchronous Processing & Queues
* Networking Metrics
  - Bandwidth
  - Throughput
  - Latency
* MapReduce

## Considerations

* Failures
* Availability and Reliability
* Read-heavy vs. Write-heavy
* Security

## There is no "perfect" system
